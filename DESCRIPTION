Title: An interface to "shotgun", a C++ parallel lasso and sparse logistic
  regression solver
Version: 0.1
Author: Steve Lianoglou
Maintainer: Steve Lianoglou <slianoglou@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides an interface to "shotgun", the
  (large-scale) parallel coordinate decent solver for lasso and sparse
  logistic regression written in C++. Sparse design matrices are supported
  via the Matrix package.  The shotgun C++ library is developed in the SELECT Lab at CMU by
  Aapo Kyrola, Joseph Bradley, Danny Bickson, and Carlos Guestrin. See
  their ICML 2011 paper and its home page for more information (links listed
  in URLs below).  NOTE: This package only runs on x86_64 bit architectures and probably does
  not work on Windows.
