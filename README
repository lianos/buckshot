This package provides an R (S4) interface to "shotgun", the (large-scale)
parallel coordinate decent solver for lasso and sparse logistic regression
written in C++

See the buckshot wiki for a quick installation and usage instructions:

Shotgun is developed in the SELECT Lab at CMU by Aapo Kyrola, Joseph Bradley,
Danny Bickson, and Carlos Guestrin.
